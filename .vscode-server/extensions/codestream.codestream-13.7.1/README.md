# Get Feedback on Work-in-Progress with Pre-PR Code Reviews

CodeStream's lightweight feedback requests let you get feedback on your changes regardless of the current state of your repo, without the friction of committing, pushing or issuing a pull request. Your teammates can review your changes right in their IDE, with full file context, and with no need to set aside their current work to switch branches or pull the latest.

CodeStream’s feedback requests encourage developers to share progress throughout the development process rather than waiting until the end or a feature branch. Get feedback on your work-in-progress to align design with implementation and streamline final code review.

# Simplified Code Discussion

Rather than copying & pasting, CodeStream enables in-editor commenting on any code in your repository, with optional sharing to Slack, MS Teams or via email, with automatic at-mentioning of code authors via git blame.

Your teammates can participate in the discussion right from their IDE, or from Slack, Teams, or replying to the email.

# Add Observability to your IDE

Resolve production errors faster and improve software performance by bringing production telemetry from New Relic into your IDE. Operations and dev teams can identify application owners quickly and work together to resolve critical errors.

In a single click, you can jump from Errors Inbox on New Relic to their IDE and step through the stack trace for code-level debugging of high-impact errors. Additionally, discover, view, filter, and update the status of open issues all from the comfort of your favorite IDE.


# Build the Knowledge Base Behind Your Codebase

CodeStream turns conversation into documentation by capturing all of the discussion about your code, and saving it with your code. Comment and code review threads are automatically repositioned as your code changes, even across branches. All with zero effort on your part.

![Knowledge Base](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamCodeStream/codestream-guide/develop/docs/src/assets/images/animated/KnowledgeBase1-VSC.gif)

Previously discussed questions and issues that explain important decisions are now accessible right where you need them, when you need them. Just click on the codemark to expand it and see how something works or why something was done a certain way.
